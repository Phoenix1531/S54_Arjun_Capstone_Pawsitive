## Problem statement

In today's world, countless pets face the harsh reality of homelessness. These animals often endure terrible conditions on the streets with slim chances of survival. Only a fortunate few, usually those in dire situations or of specific breeds, find their way to animal shelters. Unfortunately, even in shelters, the resources and facilities are often inadequate to provide the necessary care.

On the flip side, many pet owners unintentionally cause harm to their pets due to a lack of knowledge. Feeding animals unsuitable foods like chocolates and biscuits can have detrimental effects. Moreover, there is a general unawareness about the physical and mental health needs of pets, leading to neglect and inadequate care.
